> The existence of a golem is sometimes a mixed blessing. Golems are not intelligent, and if commanded to perform a task, they will perform the instructions literally. In many depictions, Golems are inherently perfectly obedient.

**Golem** is a wrapper for executing shell scripts, either in the local environment or on remote servers. It's intended to work well with [grease](https://github.com/robsheldon/grease) and [mdsh](https://github.com/bashup/mdsh) to create an environment for executable documentation.

# Status

This is currently a quick, hacky implementation of an idea I've had for a while. Still to do:

* Automated parameter parsing
* Loading new scripts with mdsh support
* Verifying new scripts with shellcheck
* Executing scripts on remote servers
